## Progress

    - Used our proposal of a coordinator useCase controlling the state and navigation in a example wizard
    - Felt the need of using Abstract class state representation or Union Types, and a copyWith function
    - Tryed at first to use navigation in the view, but using a concrete representation of the state, controll became difficult over time.
