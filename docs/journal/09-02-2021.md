## Progress

    - Code refactor resulting in joining AuthUsecase and ApiRepository so that we can control the api authentication state and comunicate it to the navigation observer without any trouble with circular dependencies
    - Built the SessionRepository and implemented logic to save session locally using SafeStorage and reopen app in a paticular point of the flow, and conversely, implemented the logic to clear locally saved session in particular user action (i.e. from PreUserSuccessPage, if the app is killed at this point, once you reopen the app, it navigates automatically from SplashPago to the PreUserSuccessPage passing the same preUser created in the last session. On the other hand, if once the app navigates to the PreUserSuccessPage, resuming the locally saved session, one tries to pop the screen, the session will be cleared and the app navigates to the first page rebooting the flow)
