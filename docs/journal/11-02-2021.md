## Progress

    - Code refactoring, It was thought to use a pattern with SmartViews (responsible to control particular feature navigation flow) and DummyViews (Views that doesn't know anything about the particular feature flow), both comunicating with feature Usecases(Implemented now as a Bloc) listening to state changes and emiting events to it.
